## Goals

To learn about building statically typed interpreted programming languages
by developing a minimal typed lisp and seeing where it goes.

## Ideas

Here are some things to explore. Could be easy, could be super hard.
Imagine the words "Static types for..." at the beginning of each list item:

- [ ] Literals and operators
- [ ] Variable bindings
- [ ] Functions (of 1 and 2 arguments)
- [ ] Arrays/lists (generic types with type parameters)
- [ ] Union types
- [ ] Algebraic data types
- [ ] Operator/function overloading
